What is bootstrapping? Here's a [definition from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrap.asp):

> Bootstrapping is building a company from the ground up with nothing but personal savings, and with luck, the cash coming in from the first sales. The term is also used as a noun: A bootstrap is a business an entrepreneur with little or no outside cash or other support launches.



## Savings & Expenses

What's bootstrapping? What's antifragile?

To be completely honest you can make bootstrapping antifragile.

## Growth

The main point of antifragile is surviving to thrive. What helps you survive is your cash and reasonable expenses that give you a buffer of several years to figure out ways of generating cash.
