This post is based on [Daniel Vassallo's bootstrapping calculator](https://github.com/dvassallo/bootstrapping-calculator).

What's bootstrapping? What's antifragile?

To be completely honest you can make bootstrapping antifragile.

The main point of antifragile is surviving to thrive. What helps you survive is your cash and reasonable expenses that give you a buffer of several years to figure out ways of generating cash.
